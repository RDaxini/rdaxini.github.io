At this year's Europe PVPMC Workshop in Copenhagen 21-22 August 2024, the pvlib user group meeting will take place with a slightly different format. This post summarises the event and invites you to get involved.

Note: There are only a few days remaining to register for the PVPMC Workshop, [click here to register](https://dtu.events/pvpmcworkshop2024) by **Monday 12 August**. To find out more about past and future workshops, head over to the [PVPMC page](https://pvpmc.sandia.gov/workshops-and-pubs/workshops/) on the Sandia National Laboratories website.

### Meeting structure

Following the usual user group meeting to discuss pvlib updates and other news, the current plan is to break out into a few tables of different interests. A broad summary of the stations is as follows:

- **Completely new** to pvlib --- Learn what pvlib is about
- **Heard** of pvlib, **potentially used** it before, would love to **contribute** --- Learn how to use GitHub (Issues, PRs, Reviews...) and make your first contribution (yes, at the workshop!)
- pvlib **tutorial** for existing users --- Work through a modelling scenario using pvlib
- Specific pvlib **usage questions** --- Get help with specific problems or questions you have about pvlib functionality and PV modelling
- **General** modelling discussion --- What is says on the tin, general discussion about modelling topics

### Making your first contribution (no prior GitHub knowledge required!)

I'll be over at the coolest table helping you get "your code" into pvlib-python. I'll be accompanied by fellow Google Summer of Code (GSoC) students. We will also be on hand to talk with you about opportunities such as GSoC to help you make contributions to pvlib through a structured program led by yourself under the mentorship of some of the pvlib wizards (aka maintainers).

If you have used pvlib before and would like to contribute, but don't know how, we'll be there to guide you through the process. We will guide you from the set up process of installing Git, right through to opening your first "pull request" (it's a way to share your code, but more on that at the meeting!)

We have already prepared some beginners tasks you can complete for your first contribution. If you have some ideas of your own for pvlib, we'll help you get started on creating an "issue" (a way to start a discussion online).

I personally only started contributing to pvlib over the last few months through my GSoC project. Prior to that, I didn't even have a GitHub account, let alone know what on earth a pull request is! Getting started was definitely the hardest part, but I can honestly say that once you're set up with a bit of guidance it's pretty smooth sailing (well, my sails still get tangled up sometimes but one of those pvlib wizards is always on hand to help!)

### Concluding remarks
- Join the PVPMC workshop in Copenhagen
- pvlib rocks
